In this project, i release: 
1. Night theme for site with saving in LocalStorage (LocalStorage builded with Custom hook).
2. React Routing with changing components without reloading page.
3. Insane speed of website (React cool boy :D ).
4. Individual page for every project with {Use Props}.
5. Cards of projects with props.
6. I took the data for cards and pages from a makeshift file (json type) (From ProjectsList.jsx in folder "helpers").
